## About the project:

This is the Final Project of the Data Analyst course carried out at the Ironhack academy, where all the tools that have been learned during the training are put into practice.

In itself, the project is a prototype of a social network that seeks to unite people who fight for the environment and against climate change.
To do this, the app presents tips, places to collaborate on environmental projects, projects that can be carried out at home and of course a carbon footprint calculator.

**Objectives:**
- Develop a carbon footprint calculator where various factors interact.
-  Create different interaction sections in Streamlit
- Carry out an analysis of the situation of social networks.
- Create an analysis on the production of carbon footprint according to the type of food.

## Methodology:
### Streamlit and Python:
For the creation of the Social Network prototype.
https://akkurat.streamlit.app/

### Tableau:
For the analysis and presentation of data related to social networks.

### SQL:
For the section on the analysis of the carbon footprint of food.
