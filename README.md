## About the project:

This is the Final Project of the Data Analyst course carried out at the Ironhack academy, where all the tools that have been learned during the training are put into practice.

In itself, the project is a prototype of a social network that seeks to unite people who fight for the environment and against climate change.
To do this, the app presents tips, places to collaborate on environmental projects, projects that can be carried out at home and of course a carbon footprint calculator.

**Objectives:**
- Develop a carbon footprint calculator where various factors interact.
-  Create different interaction sections in Streamlit
- Carry out an analysis of the situation of social networks.
- Create an analysis on the production of carbon footprint according to the type of food.

## Methodology:
### Streamlit and Python:
For the creation of the Social Network prototype.

## What is Akkurat?:
"Akkurat" is a word that comes from the Norwegian expression "Akkurat n√•" which means "Right now" and it is right now when we most need an APP of these characteristics, which has the aspects of a social network but at the same time has great potential to be a tool to change the world and make it more sustainable.

We have six different sections:

-  Ecological footprint calculator: this calculator takes into account some variables that affect.
-  Tips: different tips appear on how to improve your carbon footprint.
-  Learn: you can visit different social media profiles and websites to discover more news and projects about the environment.
-  Projects at home: in this section you can see small projects to make your home more sustainable.
-  Presentation: introduction of the APP idea.
-  Your profile: here would be your profile where you update the ecological activities you are carrying out.
